Outputs are calculated using the following constants:  
pH Scale: NBS scale (mol/kg-H2O) 
CO2 Constants:  K1, K2 from _x000C_Lueker et al., 2000
KSO4 Source: Dickson, 1990 
KF Source: Dickson and Riley, 1979
Total Boron Source: Lee et al., 2010 
   
   
Samples highlighted show the same values at field variables (eg date, temp, depth)  because they are field replicates.
